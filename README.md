# QuestRouX  
### A Gamified Campus Orientation Experience for the Roux Institute  
**CS5170 – AI for Human–Computer Interaction**  
**Final Project – Fall 2024**

QuestRouX is a mobile-friendly web application that transforms campus orientation into an engaging, game-like experience. Through quests, journaling, photo memories, AI-supported recommendations, and light social features, the app helps new (especially international) students explore the Roux Institute campus with confidence and reflection.

This project focuses on **HCI-centered design**, **AI-supported decision guidance**, and **playful interaction models** inspired by apps like Duolingo.
